#New Features
Since I last presented this project, I have added several new features, most of which relate to the settings page:

1. Added 4 themes to the app, allowing you to change the background colors of most UI components. 
2. Added the ability to sort the podcasts on the main screen by Most Recent or Alphabetically.
3. Added the ability to name episodes by filename, episode title or Publish Date.
4. Moved the alarm settings to an activity accessible from "Periodic Downloads" in the settings.
5. Added the ability to change the root folder for storing podcasts. This was added last Sunday and has not been fully tested.
6. Added the ability to "star" episodes in a Podcast's archive, in order to download individual episodes and delete them once you're done with them. This was added last Sunday and has not been fully tested.
7. Podcast summaries turn yellow if they have an episode that was downloaded the last time the RSS feed was checked.
